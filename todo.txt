Add support for Hydra, config file management. (Done for conversion.py)

Track training of the model with all info (optimizer, learning rate, batch size, ecc), saving the progress (train loss, val loss)
to a file (Done).

Add support for multiple run with differenst Hydra config files.

Overfit the model.

Regularize the model.

Hyperparameters search with ray.

Before the real training, check dropout from DeepLearning and see the problems of combining dropout with Batch normalization.

URGENT TODO:
Implement activation map.
Saliency map.
Gradient flow (with register_backward_hook of the gradient).
Visualize cnn filters.
Automatize training process of models with different parameters (easy to do with Hydra multirun).
Config all with Hydra.
Clean the code.
